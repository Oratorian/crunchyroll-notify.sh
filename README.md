# Crunchyroll Notify

**crunchyroll-notify.sh** is momentary not working.

Due to Crunchyroll killing the Video release feed that was hosted on https://www.crunchyroll.com/rss/calendar
This script stopped working as of today **29.07.2025**

The new feed is mostly news and no video release feed, that may change in the future.
I may find a workaround but this could take a while, feel free to fork and try.
