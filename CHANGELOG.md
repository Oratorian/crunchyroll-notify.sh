# Changelog

### 3.0.0 - 28.July.2025

### Added

- `--uninstall` argument to remove systemd service/timer, rsyslog, and logrotate integrations
- `--reinstall_syslog` argument to restore rsyslog config and force log recovery
- Timestamped and color-coded visual banners for uninstall clarity
- Automatic rsyslog log file recovery if deleted mid-run
- Fallback handling if log file is missing and rsyslog is not yet configured
- Dynamic `check_announced_file()` that auto-cleans old files
- Systemd `.service` and `.timer` support replacing cron
- Timer interval is now defined by `cron_time` in minutes (e.g. `"30"`) and used via `OnCalendar=*:0/30`

### Changed

- `install_cron_job()` fully replaced by `install_systemd_timer()` with OnCalendar interval control
- Early command handling (e.g. `--uninstall`) now prevents unnecessary module loading
- `01-logging.sh` no longer fails on first run or deleted logfiles; detection is deferred and guarded
- Log rotation now only installed if rsyslog is configured
- Removed dependency on static `announced_file` in config.json â€” now derived daily at runtime
- Reordered module load sequence: `check_system_requirements` now loads before config
- No more manual cleanup: announced titles are now stored in a daily auto-resetting temporary file

### Removed

- Old cronjob integration for announced file cleanup
- Static log file reference in `config.json


## 2.3.1 - 24.November.2024

### Fixed
- Fixed the announced_file handling logic to remove empty lines using sed. This ensures the announced file remains clean and prevents issues caused by blank entries in the RSS feed processing.

### Added
- Added new Config option for debug logging.
- Added logging to logfile in /var/log/crunchyroll-notify.log.
- Added Checks to install logrotate.d configuration to rotate logfile daily.
- The script now automatically checks the `config.json` file for missing keys and adds them with default values, ensuring compatibility with new features or updates.
  - Default values are only added if the section is empty or missing.

### Improvements
- Improved series checking logic, this now eliminates unnecessary processing for unmatched series titles.


## 2.2.1 - 01.November.2024

### Fixed
- Normalized line endings: Converted Windows-style line endings (CRLF) to Unix-style (LF) across all files.

### Added
- Added function to check for `config.json` existence and automatically create one with default values if not present.
